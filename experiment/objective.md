1. To demonstrate the practical implementation of half adder and full adder using the Verilog hardware description language.

2. To enable learners to simulate and analyze the behavior of adders using software tools.

3. To foster a deeper understanding of how adders can be used to build more complex circuits and how to code in Verilog.
